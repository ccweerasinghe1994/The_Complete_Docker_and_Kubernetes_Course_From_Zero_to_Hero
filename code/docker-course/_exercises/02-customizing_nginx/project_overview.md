# Project Introduction: Customizing an NGNX Server

Welcome to the project where we'll dive into customizing an NGNX server! ðŸŽ‰ Whether you're already a bit familiar with Docker or just starting out, this project is designed to help you grasp foundational concepts while having some fun along the way.

## Overview

In this project, your goal is to create and customize an NGNX server using Docker. Before peeking at the step-by-step guide, feel free to give it a shot on your own! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the main steps you should aim to follow:

1. Run a Docker container based on the NGNX image with the specific tag `1.27.0`.
2. Access an interactive shell within your running NGNX container.
3. Install a text editor of your choice (like VIM).
4. Modify the `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` file to deliver your custom content.

Take some time to attempt these steps yourself, and see how far you can get before watching the solution videos!
