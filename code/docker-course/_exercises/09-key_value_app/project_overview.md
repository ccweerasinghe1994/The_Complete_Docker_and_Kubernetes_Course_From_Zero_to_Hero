# Building a Key-Value REST API with Docker

Welcome to our hands-on project where we will dive into creating a key-value REST API! ðŸš€ This project will enhance your skills in Docker and working with multiple containers, as we utilize an Express-based application and a MongoDB database. Letâ€™s roll up our sleeves and get to work!

## Overview

Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, letâ€™s take a moment to see what you should try to implement on your own:

1. **Set up a Docker environment** for both the Express application and the MongoDB database.
2. **Define a user-defined network** to allow communication between the application and the database containers.
3. **Create volumes** for data persistence with the MongoDB container.
4. **Develop API endpoints** for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.
5. **Handle errors** with appropriate status codes based on the API logic.
6. **Include a health check endpoint** to verify that your service is up and running.

Now, it's your turn! Give it a shot and try implementing the solution above before checking out the detailed solution recordings.
