2. **Write a Dockerfile**: Define the Dockerfile to build your application image.
3. **Build the Docker Image**: Use Docker commands to create your application image.
4. **Run a Container**: Launch a container based on the image you built.
5. **Test Your API**: Hit your endpoints to ensure everything is working smoothly.
