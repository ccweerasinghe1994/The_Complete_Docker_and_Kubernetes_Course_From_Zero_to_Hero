# Docker Ignore Files: Exclude Unwanted Files in Your Build

Welcome! Today, we'll explore how to effectively use Docker Ignore files to help you exclude unnecessary files from your Docker build context. This is particularly useful for keeping your images lean by avoiding test files and other large files that you don‚Äôt need in your production environment. üê≥

## Overview

Before diving into a detailed guide, let's lay out the main steps involved in creating and utilizing a Docker Ignore file:

1. **Set up your project directory.** Create a structure that includes test files and source code.
2. **Create a `.dockerignore` file.** List the files and patterns you want Docker to ignore during the build process.
3. **Build your Docker image.** Ensure the build context does not include the ignored files.
4. **Verify the image contents.** Check that the undesired files are indeed excluded.

Try to implement these steps yourself before looking at the detailed guide below! You may find surprises and learn quite a bit in the process! üöÄ

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Your Project Directory:**

   - Create a folder for your project.
   - Inside this folder, create a structure resembling the following:
     ```
     /project
       /source
         /component1
           - component1.js
           - component1.test.js
         /component2
           - component2.js
           - component2.test.js
       - index.js
     ```

2. **Create a `.dockerignore` File:**

   - In the root of your project directory, create a file named `.dockerignore`.
   - Add lines to specify which files or patterns to ignore:
     ```
     some-large-file
     **/*.test.js
     ```

3. **Build Your Docker Image:**

   - Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to build your Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t your-image-name .
     ```

4. **Verify the Image Contents:**
   - Determine which files are included by running:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -it your-image-name sh
     ```
   - Inside the container, navigate to `/app/source/component1` and `/app/source/component2` to check that the test files are missing.

## Conclusion

In this session, we discussed how to create a `.dockerignore` file and the conceptual benefit it brings to your Docker image builds. By excluding unnecessary files from your build context, you not only streamline the build process but also ensure that your production images remain clutter-free and efficient. Keep practicing, and soon you‚Äôll find managing Docker builds becomes second nature!
