# Optimizing Docker Images by Installing Only Runtime Dependencies

Welcome to the guide on optimizing your Docker images by focusing specifically on your application's runtime dependencies. This session is all about ensuring that your Docker containers are lean, efficient, and secure! üê≥

## Overview

In this exercise, we will learn how to craft Docker images that only include the necessary dependencies required for your application to run. This practice will help reduce the overall size of your images, speed up the build processes, and enhance security by minimizing the number of installed packages.

Before looking at the step-by-step guide, I encourage you to give the implementation a try on your own! Here‚Äôs a quick summary of the main steps you‚Äôll want to follow:

1. Analyze your current Docker setup to identify unnecessary development dependencies.
2. Modify your Dockerfile to use the `--only=production` flag when installing dependencies.
3. Test your Docker image to confirm it operates as expected.
4. Check the size of your Docker image before and after the change to see the improvements.

Take a moment to try these steps yourself before consulting the detailed guide below!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access Your Dockerfile**: Start by reviewing your existing Dockerfile where you define your application‚Äôs dependencies.
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Note the packages listed in your `package.json` file and recognize which ones are purely for development (like TypeScript and testing frameworks).

3. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Change the command for installing dependencies. Use the command:

   ```
   RUN npm install --only=production
   ```

   This ensures only runtime dependencies are installed.

4. **Rebuild Your Docker Image**: Use the following command to build your Docker image again:

   ```
   docker build -t <your_image_name>:<tag> -f Dockerfile .
   ```

5. **Run Your Docker Container**: Spin up a container from your optimized Docker image:

   ```
   docker run --rm -it <your_image_name>:<tag>
   ```

6. **Validate**: Test your application to ensure everything is functioning properly, and list your installed dependencies to confirm the reduction in size and unnecessary packages.

7. **Check Image Size**: Compare the size of the new image with the previous version.

## Conclusion

By focusing on installing only the necessary runtime dependencies, you have not only reduced the size of your Docker images but also sped up your build process and enhanced the overall security of your application. This small yet impactful change can lead to better performance and maintainability in your projects. Keep this practice in mind as you continue your Docker journey! üåü
