# Optimizing Docker Images: Understanding Instruction Order

Welcome! In this guide, we'll dive into the important topic of optimizing Docker images by rearranging the order of instructions in your Dockerfile. Our goal is to ensure you can effectively leverage Docker's caching mechanism to speed up your builds! ðŸš€ Before we get started with the step-by-step guide, hereâ€™s an overview of what you should aim to implement.

## Overview

To optimize your Docker build process, focus on the order of commands in your Dockerfile. Hereâ€™s a simple list of what you should try to do:

1. Create a new Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.order`.
2. Copy the necessary commands from your existing Dockerfile into `Dockerfile.order`.
3. Start with stable commands (like dependency installations), followed by commands that are likely to change (like source code).
4. Test the differences in build times by modifying your source code and watching how the cache behaves.
5. Save and tag your final optimized Docker image properly.

We encourage you to give this a try before going through the detailed steps below!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the Dockerfile**: Open your IDE and create a new Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.order`.

2. **Copy Commands**: Start by copying the same commands you have in your original Dockerfile into this new one.

3. **Rearrange Instructions**:

   - First, copy the `package.json` and other dependency files.
   - Then, run the command to install dependencies (e.g., `npm ci`).
   - Finally, add the commands to copy your application source code.

4. **Run Build Command**: Use the terminal to build your Docker image by specifying the new Dockerfile. For example:

   ```bash
   docker build -t image_order:good -f Dockerfile.order .
   ```

5. **Test Changes**: Modify a line within your application code (e.g., add an exclamation mark in `index.js`). Then, rebuild the image to see how build time is affected.

6. **Review Cache Usage**: Check the output to see if Docker is able to leverage the cache effectively for your dependency installation.

7. **Tagging Images**: Be sure to tag your images appropriately based on the changes you made (for instance, using `good` for the optimized version and `not-so-good` for the inefficient one).

## Conclusion

In summary, the key takeaway here is to place the commands that are less likely to change at the top of your Dockerfile, such as dependency installations, while leaving the commands that are more prone to changeâ€”like your application codeâ€”at the bottom. This strategy allows Docker to effectively cache the image layers, resulting in significantly reduced build times. So, letâ€™s keep practicing this optimization technique and enhance our Docker skills further! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
