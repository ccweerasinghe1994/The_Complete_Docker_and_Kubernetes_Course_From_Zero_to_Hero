# Understanding Docker Hub and Container Images

## Overview

In this exercise, we aim to explore Docker Hub in greater detail and understand how to efficiently work with container images. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the basics of Docker Hub, image tags, and the importance of version control in your projects. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, try to implement the solution yourself using the following steps:

1. Access Docker Hub at hub.docker.com.
2. Search for popular images, such as 'Ubuntu' or 'NGINX'.
3. Examine the details of the image, including available tags.
4. Understand the relationship between different tags and the same underlying images.
5. Learn how to pin image versions for stability.

Take a moment to try out these steps on your own. Once youâ€™re comfortable, check out the step-by-step guide below!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access Docker Hub**: Open your web browser and go to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

2. **Search for an Image**:

   - Type "Ubuntu" or "NGINX" into the search bar and hit enter.
   - Browse the results and select an image that interests you.

3. **View Image Details**:

   - After selecting an image, scroll through the details to understand its features.
   - Look for documentation and information on how to use the image effectively.

4. **Check Available Tags**:

   - Click on the "Tags" tab to view the list of available tags for that image.
   - Notice how different tags may refer to the same underlying image by comparing their hash values.

5. **Pin Image Versions**:
   - Take note of the recommended practice to pin the version of the images you use to avoid potential breaking changes when new versions are published.
   - Remember to check for updates regularly to ensure you have the latest security patches.

## Conclusion

In today's lecture, we learned how to navigate Docker Hub and work with container images. Understanding the relationship between tags and underlying images is crucial, as is the practice of version pinning to maintain stability in our projects. Keep experimenting with Docker Hub and the various images available to deepen your understanding! ðŸš€
