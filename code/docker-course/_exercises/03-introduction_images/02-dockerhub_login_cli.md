# Docker Fundamentals: Docker Hub Login & CLI Usage

## Overview

In this exercise, we're diving into how to create a Docker Hub account, log in using the CLI, and manage Docker images. Before we proceed with the step-by-step guide, I encourage you to try implementing the solution on your own! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the steps:

1. Create a Docker Hub account using either email or via GitHub/Google.
2. Log in to the Docker CLI with your username and use a personal access token instead of a password.
3. Use `docker search` to find an image like Ubuntu.
4. Download images using `docker pull`, specifying the version tag if desired.
5. Check your downloaded images using `docker images`.

Now, go ahead and give it a shot! Remember, practice makes perfect! ðŸ˜„

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Creating a Docker Hub Account**:

   - Go to Docker Hub and click on "Sign Up."
   - Enter your email, username, and password, or sign up using GitHub or Google.
   - Complete the sign-up process and verify your account if necessary.

2. **Logging in via the CLI**:

   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the command `docker login`.
   - Enter your username.
   - Instead of your password, use a personal access token:
     - Go to Docker Hub, navigate to your profile, and find the "Security" section.
     - Create a new access token, name it (like "Docker-CLI"), and set the permissions.
     - Copy the generated token, return to your terminal, paste it, and press enter.
   - If successful, you'll see "login succeeded."

3. **Searching for Images**:

   - Ensure Docker is running by using the command `docker info`.
   - Use `docker search ubuntu ` to see available Ubuntu images.

4. **Pulling Images**:

   - To download the latest Ubuntu image, run `docker pull ubuntu`.
   - If you want a specific version, use `docker pull ubuntu:24.04`, substituting "24.04" for any version you prefer.
   - Check if the images were downloaded successfully using `docker images`.

5. **Verifying and Managing Images**:
   - Run `docker images` to see a list of your downloaded images, including their IDs and sizes.
   - Notice how different tags may reference the same image.

## Conclusion

Today, we explored how to set up your Docker Hub account, log in via the CLI, and work with Docker images.
