# Containerizing a React Application with Docker

Welcome! In this guide, weâ€™ll dive into the process of containerizing a React application using Docker, focusing on the powerful concept of multistage builds. ðŸš€ Before we jump into the details, letâ€™s outline what youâ€™ll try to accomplish.

## Overview

Hereâ€™s what you should aim to implement in this exercise:

1. **Create a simple React app** using the Create React App utility.
2. **Write a multistage Dockerfile** specifically designed to build your React application.
3. **Extend the Dockerfile** to copy the static files generated during the build process.
4. **Set up an Nginx server** to serve the static files effectively.

We encourage you to give this a try on your own before peeking at the step-by-step solution recordings. Challenge yourself to see how far you can get!
